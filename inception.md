## 1. Introduction

Event Pulse provides a centralized platform for discovering and sharing local events, allowing users to stay connected to their community without relying on word of mouth or traditional advertising channels. For users, the value comes from the convenience of having all events in one place, tailored to their interests, and the ability to be more socially engaged by knowing what their friends are attending.  

## 2. Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments

### IVP:
Inspiring community engagement with event aggregation.

### Initial Consumer Segments:
- NAU Students
- Flagstaff Locals
- Flagstaff Visitors

## 3. Interviews Summary

## Interview 1:
**Interviewee:** Claire Ewert, Marketing lead at NAU Campus Rec \
**Interviewer:** Anthony Mastrangelo \
**Date:** 9/19/24 \
**Customer Segments:** NAU Student \
### Key Insights:
- NAU does a decent job of getting the school events out on social media
- Neither Campus Recreation or NAU social media does that great of a job encouraging students to go to events outside of campus. \
### Representative Quotes:
- When asked about how do they find out about upcoming events: “I have to seek it out on my own, for example if I want to go see something at the Orpheum I go to their website. Otherwise I usually just hear things through word of mouth.”
- When asked about if they had ever missed out on an event that they were interested in because they were not aware of it happening: “100%. Gregory Alan Isakov came to Flagstaff, which is one of my favorite artists but I had no idea he was coming until it was already sold out.” \
### Assessment:
- Nice to have: As someone who wants to notify more students about events at Campus Recreation, this interviewee believes that this app would be nice to have for them. This would not only help them go to more events individually, but also encourage them to try and get more people involved. \

## Interview 2:
**Interviewee:** Cole Pace \
**Interviewer:** Anthony Mastrangelo \
**Date:** 9/21/24 \ 
**Customer Segments:** NAU Student \
### Key Insights:
- This interviewee did not see the importance of having a friends system within the app. They thought as though with the current age of social media that people don’t really want another app that they have to add all of the the people they know on once again.
### Representative Quotes:
- When asked about how important attending events is to you, the interviewee replied with: “Moderately important, I like to go to some but I am not necessarily always looking for one. Every now and then it is nice.”
- Also when asked about if they missed any events because they were not aware of it: “Moderately important, I like to go to some but I am not necessarily always looking for one. Every now and then it is nice.”

### Assessment:**
- Nice to have: This interviewee enjoys going out with their friends, and is always looking for more events to go to. That being said they seem to mainly go off of word of mouth of their friends, so they do not necessarily NEED the app. That being said, they do think it would make the process of finding the events a lot easier, and for that reason I think they would like to have the app but do not need it.
