# Implementation 1

**Group 06**: Event Pulse  
**Date:** 10/27/24  
**Group Members**: Anthony Mastrangelo, Andrew Gajewski, Andrew Sliva, Benjamin Levine, Samuel Butler, Zachary Garza  

## 1. Introduction

Provide a short paragraph that describes your system. This paragraph should contain the value proposition and a description of the software's main features. Include a link to your project on GitHub at the end of the introduction.   

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language. The description should be consistent with the current state of the project. You should include the link to GitHub.   

## 2. Implemented Requirements  

List in this section each requirement and associated pull request each member implemented for this release. Follow the example below---include the description of the requirement, a link to the issue, a link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable). I expect that you implement features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). All implemented features should have an automated test to verify their correct functioning. 

Create subsections for each group member. All group members should have worked on implementation activities and submitted pull requests. Only stable code should be included in the release. The code that is still under development should be in branches.
