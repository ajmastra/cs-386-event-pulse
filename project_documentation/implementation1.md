# Implementation 1

**Group 06**: Event Pulse  
**Date:** 10/27/24
**Group Members**: Anthony Mastrangelo, Andrew Gajewski, Andrew Sliva, Benjamin Levine, Samuel Butler, Zachary Garza  

## 1. Introduction

Provide a short paragraph that describes your system. This paragraph should contain the value proposition and a description of the software's main features. Include a link to your project on GitHub at the end of the introduction.   

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language. The description should be consistent with the current state of the project. You should include the link to GitHub.   

## 2. Implemented Requirements  

List in this section each requirement and associated pull request each member implemented for this release. Follow the example below---include the description of the requirement, a link to the issue, a link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable). I expect that you implement features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). All implemented features should have an automated test to verify their correct functioning.    

Create subsections for each group member. All group members should have worked on implementation activities and submitted pull requests. Only stable code should be included in the release. The code that is still under development should be in branches   

EXAMPLE:

Requirement: As a Student, I want to add a homework assignment so that I can organize my ToDo list.   
Issue: https://github.com/fake-user/project/issues/45Links to an external site.   
Pull request: https://github.com/fake-user/project/pull/426Links to an external site.   
Implemented by: Martin Fowler   
Approved by: Ada Lovelace   
Print screen: A print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable)   


Grading criteria (10 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, adequate use of language, and amount of work put into the implementation. Students can receive different grades depending on their involvement. It is expected that all members contribute with non-trivial implementation. All pull requests should be approved and integrated by the Reviewer. You should follow an adequate workflow (description of the requirement on the issue tracker, submission of the implemented requirement as a pull request, and review of the pull request by another developer).    

## 3. Test  
You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:  

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)  
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located  
An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test  
A print screen showing the result of the execution of the automated tests  
Grading criteria (4 points): You should have an adequate number of automated tests. They should be well-written to exercise the main components of your system, covering the relevant inputs.  

## 4. Adopted Technologies

List the adopted technologies with a brief description and justification for choosing them.  

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.  

## 5. Learning / Training
Describe the strategies employed by the team to learn the adopted technologies.    

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.   

## 6. Deployment

Provide a link for the system in production and describe how you are deploying your system.   
 Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be graded based on the adequate use of the technology and its adequate description.   

 ## 7. Licensing 
 Inform the license you adopted for your source code (remember to configure GitHub accordingly). Explain why you adopted this license.   
 Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.   

 ## 8. README File

( REMOVE THIS SECTION ONCE README IS DONE)   
 Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be based on the presence and quality of the information presented in the files.  

 ## 9. Look and Feel
 Describe the approach you adopted to design your user interface. Include some screenshots.   

Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be graded based on the appearance (aesthetics) and usability (ease of use) of the system.   

# Lessons learned
In retrospective, describe what your team learned during this first release and what you are planning to change for the second release.

## 10. Demo
Include a link to a video showing the system working.  
Grading criteria (6 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, the correctness of the functionalities, and the quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).
