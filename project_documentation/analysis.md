## 1. System Description

The problem of not attending NAU and flagstaff events affects NAU students and Flagstaff residents, the impact of which is not making friends and missing out on valuable memories while being a part of the community. For NAU students and Flagstaff residents who want to attend more events, make friends, and interact with their community, EventPulse is an app that gives **users** a platform to explore **event**s and find groups consisting of similar people to attend and connect at **event**s. Unlike the NAU event tracker, our product not only ***notifies*** users of events, but helps connect people, supports event organizers, and overall provides an all-in-one space to interact with **event**s and the community. EventPulse is an event tracker app that provides NAU students and Flagstaff residents with a place to explore local events, find groups of people with common interests, and discuss events. 

EventPulse will be a system that will be able to capture *data* from either ***scraping*** **event** *information* through already existing websites that hold *information *(like NAUGo, Flagstaff Events Calendar, Meetup, NAU Events Calendar, ect.) or by directly adding **event** *information* ***given*** by a **user**. Any **user** who uses the system will be able to ***add*** an **event** manually. Upon installation, Users will need to create an **account** by entering in details such as a unique *username*, a *password*, and a unique *email* for their account. A **questionare** will be shown to users following their **account** creation of the app that will help determine what type of **event**s they would participate in. Using these *interests*, our system will be able to ***create*** a "**feed**" or a **page** where recent **event**s and **event**s assumed to be interesting to the user will be shown. These **event**s will have *Titles*, *Descriptions*, *Images*, *Dates*, *Times*, *Descriptive Tags*, *Locations*, and *Reviews* so the user can easily discern important *information*. The ability to ***mark*** an **event** as *"interested"* will be a vital part in ***delivering notifications*** towards the **user**, which will help remind them of when an **event** is near or any status update occurs. **User**s will also have the ability to ***post*** **comments** or **reviews** to a specific **event** so that if a similar or same **event** is posted in the future, **User**s will have the opportunity to read, *respond*, or "*like*" a **comment**. If a **user** decides to ***post*** an **event** manually, they would be the "event coordinator" in which they have access to ***change*** any of the *information* of the **event**.
