## 1. Introduction

Event Pulse provides a centralized platform for discovering and sharing local events, allowing users to stay connected to their community without relying on word of mouth or traditional advertising channels. For users, the value comes from the convenience of having all events in one place, tailored to their interests, and the ability to be more socially engaged by knowing what their friends are attending.  

## 2. Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments

### IVP:
Inspiring community engagement with event aggregation.

### Initial Customer Segments:
- NAU Students
- Flagstaff Locals
- Flagstaff Visitors

## 3. Interviews Summary

## Interview 1:
**Interviewee:** Claire Ewert, Marketing lead at NAU Campus Rec \
**Interviewer:** Anthony Mastrangelo \
**Date:** 9/19/24 \
**Customer Segments:** NAU Student 
### Key Insights:
- NAU does a decent job of getting the school events out on social media
- Neither Campus Recreation or NAU social media does that great of a job encouraging students to go to events outside of campus. 
### Representative Quotes:
- When asked about how do they find out about upcoming events: “I have to seek it out on my own, for example if I want to go see something at the Orpheum I go to their website. Otherwise I usually just hear things through word of mouth.”
- When asked about if they had ever missed out on an event that they were interested in because they were not aware of it happening: “100%. Gregory Alan Isakov came to Flagstaff, which is one of my favorite artists but I had no idea he was coming until it was already sold out.” 
### Assessment:
- Nice to have: As someone who wants to notify more students about events at Campus Recreation, this interviewee believes that this app would be nice to have for them. This would not only help them go to more events individually, but also encourage them to try and get more people involved. 

## Interview 2:
**Interviewee:** Cole Pace \
**Interviewer:** Anthony Mastrangelo \
**Date:** 9/21/24 \
**Customer Segments:** NAU Student 
### Key Insights:
- This interviewee did not see the importance of having a friends system within the app. They thought as though with the current age of social media that people don’t really want another app that they have to add all of the the people they know on once again.
### Representative Quotes:
- When asked about how important attending events is to you, the interviewee replied with: “Moderately important, I like to go to some but I am not necessarily always looking for one. Every now and then it is nice.”
- Also when asked about if they missed any events because they were not aware of it: “Moderately important, I like to go to some but I am not necessarily always looking for one. Every now and then it is nice.”

### Assessment:**
- Nice to have: This interviewee enjoys going out with their friends, and is always looking for more events to go to. That being said they seem to mainly go off of word of mouth of their friends, so they do not necessarily NEED the app. That being said, they do think it would make the process of finding the events a lot easier, and for that reason I think they would like to have the app but do not need it.

## Interview 3:
**Interviewee:** Noah Levine \
**Interviewer:** Benjamin Levine \
**Date:** 9/22/24 \
**Customer Segments:** NAU Freshman
### Key Insights:
- This interviewee was very interested in a friend system within an application, or the group system, as he said he doesn’t enjoy going to events if his friends do not go.
### Representative Quotes:
- When asked if there was ever an event that was missed even though you were interested because you weren’t aware it was happening: “Yeah, specifically the movie night events on campus.” 
- When asked how he keeps track of or reminds himself of upcoming events: “Keep in my brain. No, I do not write it down. Mostly mental notes.”
### Assessment:
- Low Must have/ High nice to have

## Interview 4:
**Interviewee:** Chris Leckey \
**Interviewer:** Benjamin Levine \
**Date:** 9/19/24 \
**Customer Segments:** NAU Student
### Key Insights:
- This interviewee was generally uninterested in events, but when he would actually respond, he talked about friends and how important they are to his activity at events. 
### Representative Quotes:
- When asked what the primary reasons that causes him to attend an event: “Socializing with friends and peers alike.”
- When asked what features would be most useful to you for an event tracker: “A system to find like-minded people.” 
### Assessment:
- Overall “Nice-to-have,” but some features mentioned were “Don’t care.”

## Interview 5:
**Interviewee:** Logan Herbert \
**Interviewer:** Zachary Garza \
**Date:** 9/21/24 \
**Customer Segments:** NAU Junior Student
### Key Insights:
- The interviewee thought NAU’s ability to place flyers at popular locations is what makes them so successful.
### Representative Quotes:
- “I really only want to go meetings if I’m with friends”
- “I see flyers outside the union and they interest me.”
### Assessment:
- This student does not want to go to events unless they go with other people, and they rarely, if not ever, go to an actual meeting by themselves. They value something that you can get information easily, like being out and about and seeing the event.

## Interview 6:
**Interviewee:** Saul Macias \
**Interviewer:** Zachary Garza \
**Date:** 9/21/24 \
**Customer Segments:** ASU Junior 
### Key Insights:
- The interviewee said that ASU already had the ability to send notifications and already had the an event website
### Representative Quotes:
- “Only having 3 buttons to add events would be best, having too many fields takes way too long”
### Assessment:
- Doesn’t really want to go to events unless friends want to or it’s important to them. Events aren’t the top of their priority list unless they get something out of it. 

## Interview 7:
**Interviewee:** Ricky Rocchi \
**Interviewer:** Andrew Gajewski \
**Date:** 9/21/24 \
**Customer Segments:** NAU Senior Student
### Key Insights:
- Attending events is very important, a big part of why it's important is to make new friends and spend time with friends.
- He finds out about events through emails, friends, and sometimes the NAU app.
- He does say that he hasn’t missed out on any events because he wasn’t aware, he thinks the emails do a good job of notifying him.
- He just keeps track of events in his head, he says it works well but it would be nice to have one place for reminders and not have to use multiple different apps.
- He had a good suggestion for a feature, a rating system for events, similar to yelp or something like that. This would allow people who attend the events to rate them on a certain scale so people could determine what events are worth going to.
### Representative Quotes:
- “A good feature would be a scorecard of how people view a certain event, to know in advance if it is worth going or not.”
- “NAU does a good job of notifying me of events, especially emails”
- “The email system is pretty good but the problem is I always have my inbox filled.”
### Assessment:
- Nice to have, Ricky thinks NAU does a good enough job about notifying him about events, but there are a lot of reasons for him to use the app. Would help him connect with more friends, keep everything organized in one place.

## Interview 8:
**Interviewee:** Jalyn Peters  
**Interviewer:** Andrew Sliva 
**Date:** 9/23/24  
**Customer Segments:** NAU college students, local interior designers  
### Key Insights:
- Social features, like knowing where friends are going, would increase interest and participation in local events.
- A simple, user-driven tool appeals as it feels more inclusive than platforms like Facebook or Ticketmaster.
### Representative Quotes:
- "I always miss out on cool events because I never know where to look for them."
- "If I knew my friends were going, I'd definitely check out more local stuff."
### Assessment:
- Must have. This user feels strongly that a tool like Event Pulse would significantly improve their connection to campus and local events.

## Interview 9:
**Interviewee:** Justin Baird  
**Interviewer:** Andrew Sliva
**Date:** 9/22/24  
**Customer Segments:** Freelance graphic designers, college students  
### Key Insights:
- There is a gap in platforms for promoting small or niche local events, which are often lost in larger event promotion services.
- A community-driven approach, where anyone can contribute, would bring attention to more diverse and less mainstream events.
### Representative Quotes:
- "It's hard to get the word out about small local events; people just don't see them unless it's a big name or advertised."
### Assessment:
- Must have. This user sees strong potential for Event Pulse as a key tool for promoting smaller events and staying socially connected.

## Interview 10: 
**Interviewee:** Carson Redmon \
**Interviewer:** Samuel Butler \
**Date:** September 20, 2024 \
**Customer Segments:** College students, local
### Key Insights:
- Adding a verification system could help filter out events from non-legitimate users.
- It may be important to make sure there is some way that new events are pushed out to people who find them interesting. This avoids the work of having to seek out the event yourself.
### Representative Quotes:
- (when asked whether attending events was important to her:) “Extremely important. Probably one of the most important things in my life”
- “There probably should be a limit of some kind so people don’t troll or spam the feed with random events.”
- “So many places–mostly in tucson–someone will show me something and I won’t have known about it beforehand.”
### Assessment:
Nice to have. Despite her being fairly proficinet at finding local events, she belives it would be convenient to not have to look through multiple places to find events she is interested in.

## Interview 11:
**Interviewee:** Sean Lightner \
**Interviewer:** Samuel Butler \
**Date:** September 20, 2024 \
**Customer Segments:** College student, local
### Key Insights: 
- We could benefit from users being able to share how much they enjoyed the event to give others an idea of what it might be like.
- Making sure there’s a way to filter out events posted in bad-faith would be a good thing to include.
### Representative Quotes:
- “Some kind of way to filter out mis-information and make sure it’s safe and not some weird click-bait thing.”
- “Sharing pictures of the venue to show that the event was enjoyable and promote the event.”
### Assessment:
Nice to have. He believes he would go to more events if he knew more about them before going, but doesn’t currently have a huge issue with his current methods.
