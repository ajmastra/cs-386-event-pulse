# D7 - Validation
## 1. Description  
The EventPulse application utilizes a few key functionalities. There are account creation/login, user profiles, event posts, and user interests. There is a database for users and events. When users create an account, they are required to use a unique username and password. Once a user is logged into an account, they can access the rest of EventPulse's content. Users can edit their user profile, they can change their email and first name. The user database supports all of the user data. It holds a unique user id, email, username, password, first name, ineterests, and events. The list of interests that each user has can be updated at any time by completing the questionare. The questionare allows users to select which types of events they are interested in. Events are an essential feature of the EventPulse application. The Event database stores data about the event posts, such as location, title, address, etc. When a user creates an event, they are assigned to that event as a creator. Events will also have comments, where users can post comments, and view other's comments on a particular event. Events and users are searchable by their title and first name or email. There are also the coordinator and admin user types. These two user types inherit from the user class, and they have extra functionality. Whenever users create an event post, in order for it to be posted, an admin must review and confirm the event. Coordinators are able to post events without the need for admin review. Coordinators will also be able to show their organization name and position within that orginization on their profile.  

## 2. Validation (user evaluation)  
Validation aims to ensure that you developed the right product. At the beginning of the semester, you talked to the clients/potential users to understand their needs. Now it is time to check if you are on the right track by conducting some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this deliverable the following information:

**Script:** The script should have the tasks that you gave to the user, what data you collected, and the questions you asked. In particular, do not forget to add questions about the users' general impressions. You can ask open questions (e.g., How would you describe the homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the competitor X?) or closed questions (On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? On the same scale, how likely would you use the system in its current state?). Take a look at the inception and requirements deliverables to help create the script. Design a script to check if you are achieving your initial goals and if the features are implemented in a satisfactory way.
